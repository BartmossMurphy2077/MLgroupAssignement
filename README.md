# Global Human Trafficking Analysis and Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting human trafficking outcomes using machine learning models. The project includes both frontend and backend components for data visualization and model deployment.

## Features

- Data analysis and visualization of global human trafficking patterns
- Multiple supervised machine learning models for prediction as well as a stacked model implementation
- Interactive web interface for demoing the possible use of the final model
- Feature importance analysis
- Model comparison and evaluation

## Installation

1. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start the backend server:

Open a terminal and run:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Launch the frontend application:

open your web browser and go to:
```bash
http://localhost:5000/
```

## Dataset

The project uses the Global Human Trafficking dataset from Kaggle, provided by user Larxel.

## Model Analysis

The project includes several visualizations:
- Model comparison analysis
- Feature importance plots for different models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression)
- Target variable comparison
